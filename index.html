        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bee health Detection</strong> <p> Built a CNN model to predict and classify the health of bees. The model classifies the bees’ health into various categories like healthy/ hive being robbed/ ant problems/ hive beetles etc and helps in intelligent hive monitoring.</p> </li>
            <li><strong>Malaria Cell Detection</strong> <p>A GUI based application which uses a custom CNN model(Accuracy: 95.22%) to predict if an uploaded cell image is parasitized or uninfected. At first a Deep learning model was trained and tested in Google Colab based on the dataset obtained from kaggle, then in order to give it a user interface, tkinter module in Python is used.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Logistics Management System</strong> <p>A web application developed using Django framework to manage logistics operations including inventory tracking, order management, and shipment scheduling. The system features user authentication, role-based access control, and real-time data updates.</p></li>
